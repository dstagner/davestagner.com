## Installation

Navigate to your themes folder in your Hugo site and use the following commands:

```
$ mkdir themes
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/Gethugothemes/dot-hugo-documentation-theme.git

```
Check that your Hugo version is minimum `0.25` with `hugo version`.

For more information read the official [Hugo Documentation](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/).


**Important:** Take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](https://github.com/Gethugothemes/dot-hugo-documentation-theme/tree/master/exampleSite) folder of this theme. You'll find a file called `config.toml`. **To use it, copy the `config.toml` in the root folder of your Hugo site.** Feel free to change it.

Hugo includes a development server, so you can view your changes as you go :

``` sh
hugo server -w
```

Now you can go to [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) and the `Dot`
theme should be visible.

## Customizing
It is a best practice to override a file rather than modify it. This helps you easily update Hugo and the theme without loosing your customizations. To learn more see the Hugo documentation on [customizing Hugo themes](https://gohugo.io/themes/customizing)
