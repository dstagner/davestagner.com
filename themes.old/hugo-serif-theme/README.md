For more information read the official [setup guide](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

## Getting started

After installing the Serif theme successfully it requires a just a few more steps to get your site finally running.

### Adding example content

The fastest way to get started is to copy the example content. Copy the contents of the `exampleSite` folder to the root folder of your Hugo site. This theme comes with content for the following content types: `services`, `team`, `testimonials` and includes JSON data for `features` and `contact`. It also includes the `config.toml` file which has an example menu.

### Edit config

After you copy the `config.toml` into the root folder of your Hugo site you will need to update the `baseURL`

```
baseURL = "/"
```

## Running Hugo

After installing the theme, generate the Hugo site.

```
hugo
```

Hugo's built-in local server.

```
hugo server
```

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.

# Configuring theme features

### Homepage meta tags

Often a homepage requires special meta tags such as a meta description or og meta data for twitter, facebook etc. You can configure these values in the `config.toml`

```
// config.toml
[params]
  google_analytics_id=""

  [params.homepage_meta_tags]
    meta_description = "a description of your website."
    meta_og_title = "My Theme"
    meta_og_type = "website"
    meta_og_url = "https://www.mywebsite.com"
    meta_og_image = "https://www.mywebsite.com/images/tn.png"
    meta_og_description = "a description of your website."
    meta_twitter_card = "summary"
    meta_twitter_site = "@mytwitterhandle"
    meta_twitter_creator = "@mytwitterhandle"
```

### Set meta tags on a per template/page basis

You can set meta tags on a per template basis using a block. For example, you might want to write a custom meta description for the `/services` page. You can insert any valid HTML meta data inside the `{{ define "meta_tags }}` block at the top of a template.

```
// layouts/services/list.html
...

{{ define "meta_tags" }}
    <meta name="description" content="We offer a variety of services in the finance industry" />
{{ end }}

{{ define main }}
...
```
