# Adding content

```
$ hugo new <sections>/<article>.md
```

There are two types of Posts, with and without images. The cleanest
way to have them is to create a directory for those posts that have
images, and put all the post's images in that directory.

## Adding posts without images

A post without a cover image should be created with the slug as the
filename inside the directory you want, for example, to create the
post
`http://example.com/foo-first-level-section/page-at-foo-first-level`
you should create the file `/content/foo-first-level-section/foo-second-level/page-at-foo-second-level.md`

*slug* will be obtained from post's filename

## Overview

Here I don't use any image!
~~~

## Adding posts with images

Posts with images can have two types of images:

- Cover image
  - Displayed at the top section of the post
  - Used in *Facebook's OpenGraph* / *Twitter cards* metadata (a.k.a.
    the
    image that will be displayed when sharing the post in those Social
    Networks)
  - Should be defined at post's frontmatter.
- Content images
  - Images used along the post content

For example, to create the post
`http://example.com/foo-first-level-section/page-at-foo-first-level`
you should create the directory with the *slug* name and content
inside the directory as an `index.md` file
`/content/foo-first-level-section/foo-second-level/page-at-foo-second-level/index.md`.

All images used by this post goes inside the above directory (`/content/foo-first-level-section/foo-second-level/page-at-foo-second-level/`)

And *slug* will be obtained from post's directory name.

To add the cover image, so it can be displayed by OpenGraph and
Twitter, add the metadata to the **resources** frontmatter section and
put the image in the newly created directory
`/content/foo-first-level-section/foo-second-level/page-at-foo-second-level/victor_hugo.jpg`.

The featured image resource **name** must be **cover** so it will be
 used as the featured image of the article.

This follows the standard name name defined by Hugo for [Twitter Cards
featured image](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#twitter-cards).
 
Rest of images should be configured in an **images** array in front
matter, being the first one the featured image. This will be used in
Facebook's OpenGraph metadata and Twitter Cards image section, so it
is displayed when sharing them.

In *images* array, the full path after *content* directory preppended
to image name should be used, as Hugo loads them preppending the
website's domain.

Then other images in same directory and used in content `/content/foo-first-level-section/foo-second-level/page-at-foo-second-level/dcu_models.jpg`

## Overview

Hey! I have an image that it is not featured, look:

<img class="img-fluid" alt="model diagram" src="dcu_models.jpg" /> 

~~~

Tree directory structure of
`/content/foo-first-level-section/foo-second-level/page-at-foo-second-level/`
would look like:

~~~
.
|_ index.md
|_ dcu_models.jpg
|_ victor_hugo.jpg
~~~

## Adding images used in many posts

You can also add images to site's root at `/assets/img/` and then use
it directly referring them with full path `/img/....`.

For example, for `my_image.png` at `/assets/img/`
 then it can be used in multiple posts:
`<img class="img-fluid" alt="example image" src="/img/my_image.png" />`.

# Installation

Two options:

## As a git submodule

	$ git submodule add -f https://github.com/marcanuy/simpleit-hugo-theme themes/simpleit-hugo-theme

## If you don't have Hugo with git

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

    $ cd themes
    $ git clone https://github.com/marcanuy/simpleit-hugo-theme

# Updating the theme

After installing the theme, if you added it as a `git submodule`, you
can update it with:

    git submodule update --remote --merge


# Run locally

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server.

    $ hugo server -t simpleit-hugo-theme

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.

Or just set `theme="simpleit-hugo-theme"` in your configuration.

# Theme config

Have a look at
[/exampleSite/config.toml](https://github.com/marcanuy/simpleit-hugo-theme/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml)
for theme customization options.

## Website in subdirectory

If the website is located in a subdirectory like `example.com/blog/`
then URLs should be generated with an absolute path with the following
configuration:

~~~
canonifyURLs = true
~~~


# Customizing styles for your website

If you want to change some styling to fit your own website needs, copy
the following files to your website root path and edit them:

- `assets/sass/custom_variables.scss`: customize variables used by Bootstrap.
- `assets/sass/styles.scss`: your main website styles with all
  Bootstrap variables avaiable.

# Notes for developers

If you plan to change something or contribute to theme development
keep in mind that this theme uses
[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) to handle
packages, to install its dependencies:

	$ cd themes/simpleit-hugo-theme
	$ make install

All Bootstrap and Fontawesome SASS variables are available to

- customizing the variables 

  In [assets/sass/custom_variables.scss](https://github.com/marcanuy/simpleit-hugo-theme/blob/master/assets/sass/custom_variables.scss)
  you can customize Bootstrap.
  
- use variables in [assets/sass/styles.css](https://github.com/marcanuy/simpleit-hugo-theme/blob/master/assets/sass/styles.scss)
  
  For example, using Fontawesome variables like `$fa-var-twitter`, in `assets/sass/styles.scss`: 
  
  ~~~
  .twitter {
	  @include fa-icon;
	  @extend .fab;

		&:before {
			content: fa-content($fa-var-twitter);
		}
	}
  ~~~
  
  or using Bootstrap variables like `$kbd-bg` , in `assets/sass/styles.scss`:
  
  ~~~
  .shell {
    background-color: $kbd-bg;
  }
  ~~~
