This is not a standalone theme. This is a Hugo theme component.

To use this:

1. Clone this repo to ~your-site/themes/hugo-debugprint~ directory.
2. Add "hugo-debugprint" as the left-most element of the ~theme~ list variable
   in your site's or theme's ~config.toml~. Example:
   #+begin_example
   theme = ["hugo-debugprint", "my-theme"]
   #+end_example
