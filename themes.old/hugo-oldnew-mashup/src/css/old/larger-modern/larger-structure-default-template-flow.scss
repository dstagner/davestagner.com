// This file contains the basic flow element tweak for larger fonts for
// the default template for HTML on my website, it is based on CSS3 flexbox.

// The colour elements, as well as sizes are handled in default.css, OR
// if a high contrast or large font are selected, by the appropriate
// stylesheet (selected via the 'Site Aids' menu).

// Remember, for the level of specifity last rule wins, hence
// most import rules are last

// Base styles for when we have CSS3 (flexbox), which
// we know because of the media query
// i.e. these exist in base settings for browsers not supporting flexbox,
// so we have to undo these settings for flexbox.
