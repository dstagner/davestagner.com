## Using Onepress

The two main content types are blog posts and sidebar widgets.

## Widgets

To create a widget section that renders on the sidebar, go to your `layouts/partials/` folder and locate `widgets.html`.

```
<div class="widgets">
      
  <section itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Person" class="widget socials">
    <h2 class="widget-title">Socials</h2>
    <ul>
    ....
    </ul>
  </section>
  <!-- You can add multiple widgets section below -->

</div>
```

The themes has a default widget which is used to display social icons.

You can simply add widget like this below.

```
  <section class="widget customwidget">
    <h2 class="widget-title">Widget Title</h2>
    // widget body
  </section>
```

Whatever content you put inside the widget should fit properly to the widget space. This can be ad, affliate banner or call to action.

You can also reorder the widgets simply by placing anyone section above the other.

Removing a widget is simply by commenting(with html comment) that particular widget *section* or remove the *section* code entirely.

### No sidebar

If you don't want a sidebar you can set the `widgets` to *false* in the `config.toml`. This will remove the sidebar and center your site content.

```
# Widget
widgets = false
```

## Blog Posts

To create a new blog post, run:

```
$ hugo new post/post-title.md
```

## Custom CSS

To implement custom CSS sitewide, change the config.toml parameter customCSS from false to true and then go to `css.html` file in your `layouts/partials/` folder and add a css code like the example below:

```
<style>
  <!-- This will remove the shadow on the navbar -->
  a {
    border-color: orange;
  }
</style>
```

This will render inline CSS in the head of your site and without adding an extra HTTP request.

## Show Author box

If you want to show author box beneath post.

```
 authorCard = true
```

## Subscribe link
Use the parameter `subscribeLink` to create a link to a page (internal or external) that contains your email subscription form.
