If people tell you you're being an asshole, the first thing you should do is *ask yourself if you're being an asshole*. 

Because if you don't check yourself to make sure you're not being an asshole, well... you're being an asshole. 

"But wait!", you say. "I'm not an asshole!" I don't think I know anyone who is never an asshole. 

"But what if they're wrong and just being mean?" Then it cost you nothing to check yourself. 

"You're just calling me an asshole!" No, I'm not.
